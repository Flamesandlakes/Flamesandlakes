## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Daniel here!

- Iâ€™m currently working on various hobby projects (see: [my website](https://flamesandlakes.github.io/)) and otherwise on expanding my programming skillset.
- I am primarily interested in the application of data science tools on real-world phenomena. However, app and game development are also areas that I occassionally dive into.
